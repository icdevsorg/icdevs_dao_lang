# 👥🏛🏗  Purpose:

This site is dedicated to the DAO Project undertaken by ICDevs.org and funded by the DFINITY Foundation. On this site we have published the findings and thoughts that have emerged from the research conducted on DAOs and, specifically, DAOs that are efficient at optimizing the allocation of resources available to a community to grow and develop the mission of that community or system.  Of particular interest to us is the Internet Computer Ecosystem and helping the DFINITY Foundation scale it's efforts to grown and develope the infrastructure and institutions available to participants in that ecosystem. However, the information presented here has general applicability to any DAO seeking to promote a system or community.

# 🖥️  Who we are:

ICDevs.org seeks to provide the general public with
* 🏘️  **community organization**

... for the use and development of the Internet Computer and related technologies. It pursues activities such as

* **educational symposiums**

ICDevs.org is completely independent from the DFINITY Foundation and the ICA. Our goal is to further diversify and decentralize the Internet Computer ecosystem. By providing a United States-based non-profit organization we open up new, tax-advantaged ways, for US-based proponents of the Internet Computer to organize their resources and influence to advance the Ideals of the Internet Computer.
