### Context:

In the dynamic environment of a DAO, contributions from various stakeholders are essential for its growth and sustainability. These contributions may encompass code development, community management, content creation, or any role that adds value to the DAO.

### Problem:

Members of a DAO invest personal time and effort but might not have immediate financial compensation, creating a disconnect between immediate input and long-term gains. This misalignment can dissuade proactive participation and decrease the sense of ownership among members.

### Forces:

- **Motivation:** Contributors require motivation to give their best efforts towards DAO-related tasks.
- **Equity:** Fair distribution of rewards that reflects individuals' contributions to the DAO.
- **Sustainability:** Ensuring long-term engagement of contributors by binding them to the future success of the organization.
- **Decentralization:** Avoiding concentration of power or tokens by distributing it according to contribution.
- **Transparency:** Keeping the reward mechanisms clear and verifiable to all members.

### Solution:

Implement a 'Shares for Sweat' system where token-based compensation is awarded in response to verified contributions. This pattern involves setting aside a certain percentage of DAO tokens exclusively for contributor compensation. These tokens can be vested over time to ensure long-term engagement and contributions.
  
To ensure fairness and transparency, contributions should be logged and verified through a decentralized consensus mechanism or by a committee designated for this purpose. This system not only rewards past contributions but also incentivizes ongoing participation and engagement in DAO activities. 

### Therefore:

Instituting a 'Shares for Sweat' system helps align the interests of individual contributors with the long-term health of the DAO by providing a tangible stake in the organization's success.
