#### Context:
In the decentralized framework of DAOs which focus on distributing capital through grants, bounties, and hybrid investments, often a project concludes with residual insights and uncapitalized data that can significantly benefit the ecosystem if adequately harvested and utilized.

#### Problem:
Post-project phases typically lead to a scattered or uncollected set of outcomes and learnings, leading to missed opportunities for informing future decisions, strategies, and funding allocations.

#### Forces:

- **Knowledge Dispersion**: Wisdom and insights are often scattered across participants and not formally captured.
- **Resource Underutilization**: Incomplete usage of available data leads to suboptimal future projects or strategies.
- **Operational Continuity**: Ensuring the experience and insights directly influence continuous improvement in project handling and decision-making.
- **Feedback Integration**: Difficulty in systematically integrating outcomes into the strategic feedback loop of the organization.

#### Solution:
Establish specialized teams, known as Harvest Teams, within the DAO. These teams are tasked with extracting actionable insights from completed projects. The role of these teams spans collecting data, analyzing outcomes, conducting debriefs with project participants, and synthesizing a set of actionable insights and recommendations for future initiatives. The insights gathered are systematically documented and integrated into an accessible knowledge base that informs future project teams and funding decisions. 

Real-world examples include retrospective teams in software development, where learnings are harnessed to pave the way for better processes and products. Another instance can be seen in academic research, where systematic reviews and meta-analyses utilize past research results to create new knowledge and recommendations. 

#### Therefore:
Create Harvest Teams to systematically capture, analyze, and integrate project insights into the DAOâ€™s knowledge management systems, enhancing strategic decision-making and resource allocation.
