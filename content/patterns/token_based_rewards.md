### Context:
In the DAO ecosystem, ensuring ongoing participation and contribution to organizational goals is critical. Traditional organizations may rely on salary or equity-based systems, but DAOs require mechanisms that reflect their decentralized, digital-first nature.

### Problem:
How can a DAO incentivize sustained and meaningful contributions from its members, align activities with strategic goals, and ensure commitment over time?

### Forces:
- **Incentivization**: Effective incentives drive participation and performance but must be structured to encourage long-term engagement.
- **Volatility**: Token values can be highly volatile, which may affect the perceived value of the rewards.
- **Scalability**: Incentive systems must scale with the organization and remain manageable as member numbers grow.
- **Decentralization**: Rewards must align with the ethos of decentralized governance and operation.

### Solution:
Implement a token-based reward system wherein contributors to the DAO are compensated with organizational tokens for their efforts. These tokens can have multiple utilities within the ecosystem besides just monetary value, such as voting rights or access to exclusive services. To motivate long-term commitment and reduce turnover, the reward system could include vesting periods or phased releases based on milestones.

### Therefore:
Structure the distribution of tokens to balance immediate rewards with long-term incentives that ensure contributors remain engaged over time and contribute to the DAOâ€™s evolving needs.
