### Supports:
* [Multi-factorial Consensus](./multi_factorial_consensus.html)
* [Credible Neutrality](./citizen_voting.md.md)

### Context:
In the DAO landscape, governance and decision-making processes often need to reflect the ethos of decentralization fully. One person, one vote is a democratic principle that supports an equal say for all participants, regardless of their wealth or stake in the system.

### Problem:
Implementing a fair and equitable voting system where each participant has an equal influence is challenging, especially when addressing the Sybil issue where a single agent could create multiple identities to gain disproportionate control.

### Forces:
- **Equality vs. Stake Weight:** Balancing the influence of each vote while considering the stakes held by participants.
- **Sybil Attacks:** Ensuring robust identity verification mechanisms to prevent fraudulent vote manipulation.
- **Technological Limitations:** Deploying scalable and secure systems that maintain the integrity and anonymity of votes.
- **Community Trust:** Developing a system that promotes fairness and transparency to gain and maintain community trust.

### Solution:
Citizen Voting in DAOs should be implemented using cryptographic methods like zero-knowledge proofs or token-based systems where tokens are non-transferable and identity verification ensures one token per verified human. This system can work alongside a digitally verified identity system, ensuring that every member has only one account eligible for voting.

Real-world examples include DAOs like [Democracy Earth](https://www.democracy.earth/), which implements sovereign identities allowing for one person one vote within digital environments. Similarly, [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) offers a social identity network that can link individuals uniquely to their respective DAO voting rights, thus mitigating Sybil attacks.

### Therefore:
Adopt Citizen Voting to ensure each member has an equal say in the decision-making process, backed by a secure, Sybil-resistant identity verification mechanism.
