### Context:

DAOs operate in an ecosystem heavily reliant on voluntary, often part-time participation. Contributors usually juggle their involvement alongside other personal and professional commitments, leading to potential burnout and decreased productivity if not properly managed.

### Problem:

Participants in DAOs can suffer from burnout due to overcommitment, misaligned incentives, or unclear boundaries between their DAO contributions and other life obligations. This can lead to decreased effectiveness, lowered morale, and eventually attrition from the DAO.

### Forces:

- **Balance**: Need for contributors to balance DAO tasks with personal life.
- **Engagement**: High engagement can lead to overcommitment if not checked.
- **Motivation**: Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations that drive participation.
- **Sustainability**: Needs for operations that do not lead to contributor exhaustion.

### Solution:

Implement a **"Well Being"** model that fosters a balance between participation in DAO activities and personal well-being. This includes:
- **Flexible Participation**: Implement systems and structures that appreciate the non-full-time capability of most contributors, enabling them to contribute as their personal schedules allow.
- **Defined Work Boundaries**: Clearly outline scopes and limits in roles and tasks to prevent overcommitment.
- **Incentive Structures**: Develop incentives that encourage sustainable engagement levels without overwhelming the participants.
- **Right to Resignation**: Ensure an easy and penalty-free process for opting out or taking breaks from roles within the DAO.
  
Empowering participants through flexible contributions and well-defined work limits directly improves mental health and sustains long-term engagement in DAO environments. For instance, systems that respect personal time, like not expecting contributions during late hours unless it's crucial, and platforms that allow temporary stepping down or switching roles without negative repercussions, enhance operating dynamics.

### Therefore:

Adopt policies and technologies that safeguard contributor well-being, harmonizing DAO productivity with personal health and commitments. Implement systems that support part-time contributions and ensure voluntary activities do not overwhelm personal life domains.
