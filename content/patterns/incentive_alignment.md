### Context:

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) use coded incentives to encourage behavior that aligns with their overarching goals. The balance between short-term individual gains and long-term collective goals is crucial.

### Problem:

Ensuring that all participants in the DAO are working effectively towards shared, long-term objectives without being primarily motivated by short-term rewards.

### Forces:

- **Individual Goals vs Collective Goals**: Balancing individual interests with the group's long-term objectives.
- **Short-term Rewards vs Long-Term Investment**: Ensuring incentives support sustained engagement and not just immediate outcomes.
- **Complexity in Setting Metrics**: Difficulty in defining and quantifying what successful contributions look like in a decentralized setting.

### Solution:

To solve the misalignment of incentives, DAOs can employ various strategies such as performance-based bonuses, token-based rewards, and democratic participation incentives. These ensure that contributions towards the DAOâ€™s objectives are encouraged and rewarded, thus aligning individual actions with collective goals.

1. **Token-Based Rewards**: Issue native tokens that appreciate based on the overall success and adoption of the DAO's projects. For instance, MakerDAO uses MKR tokens to align the interests of the holders with the success of its stablecoin DAI.

2. **Performance-Based Bonuses**: Link rewards directly to the impact or performance as measured against predefined metrics. The Ocean Protocol uses performance-based token dispersal to reward community contributions that improve the platform.

3. **Democratic Participation Incentives**: Reward members for their involvement in governance and decision-making processes. This can be implemented as a token reward for voting in crucial decisions, similar to the mechanism used by Compound Finance.

### Therefore:

Implement a multi-faceted incentive system within a DAO that rewards both the participation in governance and the contributions to projects that align with the DAO's long-term goals, ensuring sustainability and progressive growth.
