### Context:
In a DAO, efficiently identifying and funding projects that are aligned with the organization’s objectives is critical to its success and sustainability.

### Problem:
The challenge lies in creating a transparent, fair, and effective process for soliciting, evaluating, and selecting projects to ensure that capital is allocated to initiatives that provide the most value to the DAO and its stakeholders.  Grant programs without specific RFPs tend to have a broader array of misaligned and poor proposals.

### Forces:
- **Fairness:** All potential contributors require an equal opportunity to submit proposals.
- **Quality Assurance:** The DAO needs a mechanism to ensure that funded proposals meet a certain quality standard and are likely to achieve their objectives.
- **Community Alignment:** Projects should align with community goals and values.

### Solution:
Implement a structured Request for Proposals (RFP) process that outlines specific project needs, invites solutions, and encourages competitive innovation. This will include:
1. **Clear RFP Guidelines:** Creating detailed documentation on the submission requirements, evaluation criteria, and selection process.
2. **Open Submission Platform:** Utilizing DAO’s platforms to make all RFPs accessible to potential proposers and ensure submissions are transparent and open to community review.
3. **Review Committee:** Forming a committee, possibly with rotating membership, to evaluate proposals based on pre-defined criteria.
4. **Community Voting and Prioritization:** Enabling the broader community to vote on and prioritize proposals, or elements of proposals, making the selection process more democratic and aligned with community values.

### Therefore:
Configure a robust and transparent RFP process that ensures fair participation and selects proposals that align with the DAO's strategic goals. This process should also inspire confidence within the community through its openness and objective criteria.
