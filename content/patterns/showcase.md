#### Supports:
* [Grants](./grants.html)
* [Celebrations](./celebrations.html)

#### Context:
In the dynamics of DAOs where transparency and community participation are central, showcasing successful projects and their outcomes promotes trust, inspiration, and accountability. It serves as a critical method for highlighting the impact of investments and fostering a competitive and innovative environment.

#### Problem:
Without a structured platform for highlights, projects that receive funding from DAOs may go unnoticed by a broader audience, thus underutilizing learning opportunities and diminishing the visibility of successful outcomes which could attract further investment and community engagement.

#### Forces:

- **Visibility:** Increased visibility helps in recognizing efforts and motivates current and future contributors.
- **Accountability:** Needs to provide end-to-end transparency on use of funds and deliverables.
- **Engagement:** Enhance community engagement and provide tangible examples of project success.
- **Benchmarking:** Facilitate comparative analysis of project outcomes against set goals and other similar projects.

#### Solution:
Create a mandatory "Showcase" mechanism as part of the concluding phase of any project funded via DAOs. This could take form as a virtual gallery, regular showcase events, or comprehensive annual compilations. Each participant must present their project’s intention, execution, results, and lessons learned in a structured and engaging format. Ensure all showcases are:

1. **Hosted on DAO’s platform:** Consolidate presentations in a single accessible location.
2. **Integrated with Social Media and Other Channels:** Broaden outreach by simultaneously posting on social media or relevant platforms.
3. **Encouraging Interactive Feedback:** Allow community feedback directly on the showcase platform to foster discussions.
4. **Linked to Documentation and Reports:** Provide links to detailed project reports and documentation.
5. **Celebrating Achievements:** Include formal recognition like 'Project of the Month' or community-driven awards.

#### Therefore:
Implement Showcase with defined guidelines and rewards to ensure comprehensive and engaging display of project outcomes, thereby strengthening community ties and fostering a transparent culture of accountability and celebration of achievements.
