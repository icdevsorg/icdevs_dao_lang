#### Context:
In decentralized environments, where traditional hierarchical structures of influence and communication are often flattened or absent, the role of actively engaged community members becomes critical. These individuals play a central role in driving community engagement, facilitating knowledge sharing, and promoting the health of the DAO.

#### Problem:
Traditional structures do not necessarily exist in DAOs to promote engagement or ensure that messages and goals are communicated effectively across all community members. This can lead to disengagement, miscommunication, and a lack of active participation in decision-making processes.

#### Forces:

- **Engagement Needs**: Without a structured engagement mechanism, community participation may wane.
- **Communication Barriers**: In global, decentralized networks, consistent and effective communication can be challenging.
- **Influence Distribution**: Ensuring that influence is not centralized but distributed fairly among active and engaged community members.

#### Solution:
Identifying and empowering Community Champions within the DAO can address these challenges. Community Champions are active, engaged members who are particularly passionate about the DAO's vision and operation. They are empowered to act as nodes of communication, engagement, and influence within the broader community. This role can include organizing events, leading discussions, onboarding new members, and being a go-to person for new community members seeking guidance.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Selection Criteria**: Define what makes a Community Champion - usually factors like time spent in the community, contributions, and peer recognition.
2. **Empowerment**: Provide Champions with the tools and recognition they need to be effective. This can include special access to project teams, direct lines to governance committees, and platforms for broadcasting their messages.
3. **Feedback and Support**: Regularly collect feedback from the community on the effectiveness of Champions and ensure they have continuous support (both community and resources) to remain effective.

**Real-World Examples:**
- Ethereum has seen success with this model where certain members of the community take it upon themselves to create educational content, moderate forums, and organize meet-ups which enhances community cohesion and engagement.
- The MakerDAO community integrates designated community leads who focus on specific areas like governance communication, enhancing transparency, and participation in decision-making.

#### Therefore:
Empower passionate community members to become Community Champions to enhance communication, engagement, and distributed influence within the DAO.
