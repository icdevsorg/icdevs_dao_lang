#### Supports:
* [Grants](./grants.html)

#### Context:
In the DAO ecosystem, providing feedback on grant proposals and bounty submissions is crucial to fostering a culture of improvement and engagement. When submissions are rejected, applicants often feel disheartened or confused about the rationale, which can diminish trust and participation.

#### Problem:
Applicants receiving rejections for grants or bounties may feel unfairly treated or demotivated if they do not understand the reasons behind the decision, or if the feedback is too generic or critical. This can deter skilled contributors from reapplying or participating further in the DAO.

#### Forces:

- **Transparency vs. Sensitivity:** Balancing clear, constructive feedback with the need to prevent discouragement or negative perceptions.
- **Improvement vs. Rejection:** Encouraging applicants to improve their proposals versus merely rejecting them without offering growth pathways.
- **Engagement vs. Efficiency:** Providing personalized feedback takes resources and time, which needs to be done efficiently to maintain engagement without draining DAO resources.

#### Solution:
Implement a structured feedback mechanism that provides general guidelines and positive, actionable steps for rejected applicants. Feedback should focus on how to improve future submissions rather than dwelling on the shortcomings of the current proposal. This "bridge" feedback should:

1. Highlight aspects of the proposal that align with the DAO's goals.
2. Suggest specific areas for improvement, like clarifying objectives, demonstrating feasibility, or aligning with strategic priorities.
3. Provide resources or workshops available to applicants seeking to improve their skills or understanding of DAO operations.
4. Encourage reapplication in future rounds with refined proposals, reinforcing the DAO's commitment to nurturing potential.

This approach avoids direct criticism that might be taken personally and focuses on constructive development, encouraging learning and persistence.

#### Therefore:
Applicants should be encouraged to view rejection not as a failure, but as a stepping stone for growth. Efficient and empathetic feedback mechanisms ensure ongoing engagement and professional development within the DAO community.
